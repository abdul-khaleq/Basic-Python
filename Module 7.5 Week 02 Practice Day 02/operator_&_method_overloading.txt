Operator Overloading:
Operator overloading means giving extended meaning their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two string and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator os overloaded by int class and str class. You might have noticed that same build in operator or funtion  shows different behavior for object of different classes this is called "Operator Overloading".

Method Overriding:
Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
